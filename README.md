Take a look at [the demo](https://github.com/Kentzo/ShortcutRecorderDemo).

This is a stripped down version of https://github.com/Kentzo/ShortcutRecorder, as I didn't like having PTHotKey included.

Get Sources
-----------
The preferred way to add the ShortcutRecorder to your project is to use git submodules:  
`git submodule add git://github.com/Bytespider/ShortcutRecorder.git`
You can download sources from the site as well.

Integrate into your project
---------------------------
First, add ShortcutRecorder.xcodeproj to your workspace via Xcode ([Apple docs](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#recipes/xcode_help-structure_navigator/articles/adding_a_project_to_a_workspace.html)). Don't have a workspace? No problem, just add ShortcutRecorder.xcodeproj via the "Add Files to" dialog.

Next step is to ensure your target is linked against the ShortcutRecorder framework ([Apple docs](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#recipes/xcode_help-project_editor/Articles/AddingaLibrarytoaTarget.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010155-CH17)). Desired frameworks will be listed under *Workspace*.

Now it's time to make frameworks part of your app. To do this, you need to add custom Build Phase ([Apple docs](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#recipes/xcode_help-project_editor/Articles/CreatingaCopyFilesBuildPhase.html)). Remember to set *Destination* to *Frameworks* and clean up *Subpath*.

Finally, ensure your app will find frameworks upon start. Open Build Settings of your target, look up *Runtime Search Paths*. Add `@executable_path/../Frameworks` to the list of paths.

Add control in Interface Builder
--------------------------------
Since Xcode 4 Apple removed support for custom control, unfortunately. However, you can still use it to add and position/resize ShortcutRecorder control. To do this, you need to add Custom View and set its class to SRRecorderControl.  

SRRecorderControl has fixed height of 25 points so ensure you do not use autoresizing masks/layout rules which allows vertical resizing. I recommend you to pin height in case you're using Auto Layout.
